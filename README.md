# simple capture data with tcpdump :ninja:
 This is a program to receive the network data of the target system, which is written in a simple way :smiling_imp:
 ## using
```
git clone https://github.com/Sobanggg/simple_dataCapture
```
```
chmod +x starter.sh
```
```
./starter.sh
```
Then run the Lesnar file on your system and transfer the other file to the target system and run it (with root access) :robot:
### Hints 
This script uses the tcpdump tool, which is by default on most Linux distributions!

After receiving the file, you can read it with the ``` tcpdump -r capture.pcap ``` command
